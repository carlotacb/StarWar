# StarWar
Game created for a project in the university (UPC) - _Code done in October 2015_


## Content

This is a **beta version** of a game done in a EDA, a subject of **Data structures and algorithms**. 

It consists on a StarWars ship that have to recolect coins and dodge bullets. In my version the ship does not shoot, but the option is implemented in the functions of the ship.

The code of the ship controlled by my you will find in AlCaza123.cc, the other files are necesary for the correct operation of the game.


This is a **beta version** of a project for the Data Structures and Algorithms course (FIB-UPC). 

We were given a game environment based on Star Wars ship battles. 
Each ship scored points by collecting coins and dodging bullets. Ships could move in different directions, with variable speeds, and they could also shoot both the asteroids (to open new paths or avoid collisions) and the other ships (to kill them for a certain amount of time). 
Our goal was to create the best possible AI for a ship, and then battle the other students' AIs in a round based tournament. The code for my AI can be found in AICaza123.cc. My AI does not have the option of shooting because it's a beta version as I already say.

The rest of the files are required for compiling and executing the game.
