# StarWar
Game created for a project in the university (UPC)

### Content

This is a **beta version** of a game done in a EDA, a subject of **Data structures and algorithms**. 

It consists on a StarWars ship that have to recolect coins and dodge bullets. In my version the ship does not shoot, but the option is implemented in the functions of the ship.

The code of the ship controlled by my you will find in AlCaza123.cc, the other files are necesary for the correct operation of the game.
